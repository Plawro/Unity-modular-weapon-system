# Unity-modular-weapon-system
## Modular, custom, verified & tested
This is a FREE Unity weapon system made by me, Every weapon has it's own script, so you can use melees, guns, etc.
Switch weapon using scroll wheel, shoot with RMB, secondary fire with LMB and reload with R (these 3 shortcuts are just listeners, they can do anything you want them to do when pressed)

## How to use
Download the files and drag them to your Unity project (except LICENSE & README.md),
Put the player prefab into Scene and configure your weapons,
to make your own weapons, just copy those that already exist ( :DD )
The system works well, but I was lazy to makeactual working guns, so make the gun logic yourself or find a tutorial (sry)
enjoy!
